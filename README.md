## FlooringMastery

Given a “client” specification from an imaginary flooring company, this is a CRUD application which aids their order process. The application allows users to display orders by date and view active orders, create/save new orders, edit/remove existing orders, and export all orders into a text file. In terms of the technical aspects, the project follows the MVC design pattern and uses the Spring Framework for Dependency Injection.
